            "claimMechanisms": "Heat exposure induces an increase in heart rate and vascular compliance by promoting vasodilation and improving blood flow. This mimics the cardiovascular effects of light exercise, as the body's core temperature rises, stimulating the autonomic nervous system and enhancing circulation throughout the body.",
            "claimProtocolInstructions": "1. Hydrate adequately before starting; drink at least 500 ml of water to prevent dehydration.\n2. Begin with 10-minute sessions at a moderate temperature (70–90°C or 158–194°F).\n3. Gradually increase session duration by 5-minute increments and heat intensity, aiming for a maximum of 20 minutes per session as tolerated.\n4. Take breaks between sessions if using multiple rounds to cool down and regulate your body temperature.\n5. Listen to your body; leave the sauna immediately if you feel lightheaded, dizzy, or overheated.",
