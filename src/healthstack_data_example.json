Research indicates that IF can reduce **body weight** and **fat mass** in both overweight and normal-weight individuals. \n\n The evidence is derived from **randomized controlled trials** and **observational studies**, which suggest that IF can be an effective strategy for **weight management**. \n\n However, the results can vary based on individual **adherence** and the specific type of **fasting protocol** used. \n\n Limitations include the **variability** in study designs and the need for **long-term studies** to confirm sustained benefits.",

Studies have shown that regular aerobic activity, such as running, cycling, or swimming, can significantly reduce body fat percentage. This effect is observed across various populations, including both overweight and normal-weight individuals. The evidence is primarily derived from randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies, which consistently demonstrate a reduction in body fat with sustained aerobic exercise. However, individual results may vary based on factors such as exercise intensity, duration, and adherence to the regimen.",

Studies have shown that regular aerobic activity, such as running or cycling, improves cardiovascular efficiency, leading to increased stamina and reduced fatigue. Participants in various trials reported feeling more energetic and alert after consistent aerobic exercise routines. The evidence is robust, with numerous studies supporting these findings across diverse populations. However, some limitations include variations in exercise intensity and duration, which can affect outcomes.",
