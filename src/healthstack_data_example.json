            "claimMechanisms": "Heat exposure induces an increase in heart rate and vascular compliance by promoting vasodilation and improving blood flow. This mimics the cardiovascular effects of light exercise, as the body's core temperature rises, stimulating the autonomic nervous system and enhancing circulation throughout the body.",
            "claimProtocolInstructions": "1. Hydrate adequately before starting; drink at least 500 ml of water to prevent dehydration.\n2. Begin with 10-minute sessions at a moderate temperature (70\u00e2\u20ac\u201c90\u00c2\u00b0C or 158\u00e2\u20ac\u201c194\u00c2\u00b0F).\n3. Gradually increase session duration by 5-minute increments and heat intensity, aiming for a maximum of 20 minutes per session as tolerated.\n4. Take breaks between sessions if using multiple rounds to cool down and regulate your body temperature.\n5. Listen to your body; leave the sauna immediately if you feel lightheaded, dizzy, or overheated.",

            "claimDescription": "Resistance training is a foundational method for building strength by using exercises that apply external or body weight resistance to target and develop muscle force production.",
            "claimMechanisms": "Resistance training promotes strength gains by recruiting and adapting fast-twitch muscle fibres and improving neuromuscular efficiency. This process is driven by the principle of progressive overload, where the resistance is systematically increased to challenge the muscles and stimulate maximal force production.",
            "claimProtocolInstructions": "1. Perform resistance training exercises 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 times per week, targeting major muscle groups.\n2. Use heavy resistance to complete sets of 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 repetitions, with an ideal target of 3 reps per set for maximal strength development.\n3. Incorporate compound movements such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and overhead presses to engage multiple muscle groups.\n4. Rest for at least 2 minutes between sets, with an optimal rest range of 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 minutes to ensure recovery and maintain high effort.\n5. Focus on proper form and controlled movements to avoid injury and maximise effectiveness.\n6. Gradually increase the resistance over time to ensure progressive overload.\n7. Avoid excessive volume and focus on intensity, performing 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 sets per exercise.\n8. Consult a fitness professional if you are new to resistance training or have pre-existing conditions or injuries.",
